This is a fork of a claudia.js integration with slack command on AWS Lambda
really easy and straightforward. Not for publishing.

we are going to build a little Slack Slash Command called pingu. The need came from my current team at work where we sometimes need a quick way of checking response-times for our sites. With pingu you can, in Slack, just go /pingu http://www.marcusoft.net and it will return you a message about how long it took to request that url.
